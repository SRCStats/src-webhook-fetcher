# SRC Webhook Fetcher
A relatively basic program designed to search the API of [speedrun.com](https://speedrun.com) for new runs in the new, verified, and rejected categories, then subsequently store them in a MongoDB database. Designed for a serverless model, working alongside another function to respond to webhooks for each run.
